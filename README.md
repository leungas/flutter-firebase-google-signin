# Google Sign In Example

This repo is not a complicated one, but it contains several key pointers who try to work with Android + Firebase.

1. Make sure you get Android X compatibility

2. Make sure you create a project on Firebase WITH SHA-1 debug finger print

- If you are working in teams, make sure all fingerprints are on there.

3. Make sure you visit Google API Console and set OAuth Consent! This will get rid of the 12500 exception.

On iOS this is simple - just follow the installation instruction on firebase_auth repo.
